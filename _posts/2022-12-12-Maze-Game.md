- Built a 2-D pixel-based maze game in Java which includes a Depth-First Search randomly generated map, and a character that can move to explore the maze world by inputs from keyboard.
- Counted the steps of character as well as the score it gets via reaching to treasures which are randomly distributed around the map, then synchronously displayed such information on GUI based on StdDraw.
- Implemented game saving/ loading feature with XML data format.
